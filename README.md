# movie-recommendation-system
With the help of cosine-similarity algorithm, a content based movie recommendation system is designed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Algorithm used: 

1> first various parameters of data is studied to identify useful features -> 

2> those features in text format are converted into number format for processing ->

3> cosine-similarity algorithm is applied to find angular distance between features of different movie ->

4> those with minimum angular distance is shown as output.

Description:

1> cosine_similarity.py : contains described implimentation od cosine similarity algorithm

2> main.ipynb : code to apply algorithm upon movie dataset with intermediate results and final result

3> main.py: code with comments and proper description to apply algorithm upon movie dataset with final result

4> movie_dataset.csv : csv file containing imdb dataset
